## GitHub Action

In order to automatically push your doc on github pages you need to create a new branch called `gh-pages`

```bash
git checkout -b gh-pages
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
```

Then head over the **Settings** in your repo and select the right branch and folder under the **pages** section.
