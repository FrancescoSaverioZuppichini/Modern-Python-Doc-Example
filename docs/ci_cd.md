## GitHub Action

In order to automatically push your doc on github pages you need to create a new branch called `gh-pages`

```bash
git checkout -b gh-pages
git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages
```

### Github Pages Settings
Then head over the **Settings** in your repo and select the right branch and folder under the **pages** section. As shown below:

### Action permission

Then we need to make sure our actions can write in the repo, go on **Settings/Actions/General** and under **Workflow permissions** select **Read and write permissions**.

### Action

The action will be triggered on push to `main`. You can read more about action customization in the [official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions). The action uses the amazing premade [`github-pages-deploy-action`](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action) by [JamesIves](https://github.com/JamesIves). 

Below the code for reference.
